# Alien-Space-Programs

This add-on introduces new challenges to Kerbal Space Program, by relocating the Kerbal Space Center to one of the other terrestrial planets in the stock system. This requires a version of Kopernicus that matches your KSP installation.

### Artemis-Kerbol Lite (Laythe Space Program)
Starting from Laythe gives players a new perspective while still being familiar. With Laythe's thick, oxygen-righ atmosphere, early career jet engines will work and Kerbin-designed rockets should fly. Watch out for weaker solar power generation and a thicker upper atmosphere, and enjoy the persistent view of Jool on the horizon.

### Little Green Men from Duna (Duna Space Program)
Starting from Duna may seem easier with its weaker gravity and thinner atmosphere, but jet engines won't work for lack of oxygen and aircraft will need much larger wing spans. Pack extra parachutes or retro-rockets for those return trips.

### KSP BadS Mode (Eve Space Program)
Starting from Eve is as tough as it sounds. The environment is unforgiving and has little diversity. Consider adding Eve Optimized Engines and Explodium-Breathing Engines, as regular rockets just don't work as well here.

### To install:
Use a clean KSP installation, as old save games won't work. Install a supported edition of Kopernicus first, then launch KSP normally. Kerbin should appear rotated 180 degrees in the main menu screen if successful. Then exit, and drop one of these folders (LaytheSpaceProgram, DunaSpaceProgram, or EveSpaceProgram) in your GameData folder. Start KSP to make sure your chosen homeworld appears on the main menu screen. Then exit and add any mods or add-ons you want on top of this.
