	@RESULTS
	{
		%TyloFlyingHigh = There's something resisting your momentum up here. Wasn't Tylo supposed to be airless?
		%TyloFlyingLow = There isn't much of an atmosphere, but it <em>is</em> there.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[evaReport]]:FOR[AlienSpacePrograms]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		%TyloFlyingHigh = Don't let go... don't let go... don't let go...
		%TyloFlyingLow = You hope your parachute still works here.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]:FOR[AlienSpacePrograms]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		%TyloFlyingHigh = The Goo is not feeling at home as it was higher up.
		%TyloFlyingLow = The Goo jiggles, wobbles, clumps into spheres and becomes brittle, all at once.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]:FOR[AlienSpacePrograms]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		%TyloFlyingLow = One of the samples is hardening, and is on the verge of shattering. The others don't react at all.
		%TyloFlyingHigh = The high radiation environment caused a few of the samples to glow. One of those samples is hardening.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]:FOR[AlienSpacePrograms]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		%TyloFlyingLow = The sunlight doesn't seem to raise temperatures here much.
		%TyloFlyingHigh = It's almost, but not quite, like space.
		%TyloSrfLandedLowlands = Didn't they have a name for this kind of cold? Oh right: 'Winnipeg.'
		%TyloSrfLanded = The air, if you could call it that, is really cold at night and not- as- cold- but- still- really - cold in the day.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]:FOR[AlienSpacePrograms]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		%TyloFlyingHigh = It's faint, but there's some atmospheric pressure here.
		%TyloFlyingLow = No atmosphere, they told you. A barometer wouldn't work, they told you. So much for them.
		%TyloSrfLanded = Yep, definitely an atmosphere.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]:FOR[AlienSpacePrograms]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		%TyloFlyingHigh = Picking up traces of nitrogen up here.
		%TyloFlyingLow = Nothing but nitrogen all around. And maybe bits of dust. You hope you can clean it out.
		%TyloSrfLanded = Once the dust settled from landing, you found nitrogen and maybe traces of other stuff.
		%TyloSrfLandedLowlands = Isn't this the stuff they fill tires with back home? You look for your green valve caps.
