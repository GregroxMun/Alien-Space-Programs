//Explanation, Details, and Tips.
//If you're the type of person who likes to figure gameplay out on your own, don't read this.
//Re-written NOV 2018 Gordon Fecyk. Original from GregroxMun is in the GitHub Repository.
//----------------------------------------------------------

// ==== Eve ====
//Stock Eve puts the space center near sea level, which means you have 5 atmospheres of pressure.
//Realistic atmospheres puts Eve's ceiling at 60km instead of 90, but at sea level this raises pressure to 9 atmospheres!
//	To accommodate craft from previous versions, KSC is moved up to about 4 km altitude on a ridge to the west.
//	Pressure at 4 km is closer to 5 atmospheres, so craft designed for Stock Eve or pre-1.5.1 ASP should work.
//To reset to the default stock atmosphere, set AspRealisticAtmospheres to False.
//	This will make it harder, more authentic to stock, but less realistic.
//For engines that work at 5 atm, download OhioBob's Eve Optimized Engines.
//	For jet engines, download Gordon Fecyk's Explodium-Breathing Engines.

// ==== Kerbin ====
//Kerbin reverts the system to mostly stock, only using Realistic Atmospheres for consistency.
//	Change AspRealisticAtmospheres to False to change back to Stock.
// ** Stock Save Warning! **
//If you have craft in really low orbits around Duna, Laythe, Jool or Tylo in your save,
//	raise them to higher orbits prior to changing AspRealisticAtmospheres to True.
//	Also, some career mode contracts may disappear if they refer to Kerbin because Kerbin is renamed internally.
//	Keep a backup and be cautious about importing a stock save into this environment.

// ==== Minmus ====
//Minmus Space Program is remarkably easy. No atmospheric drag does mean you have to descend under power,
//	but even an EVA Kerbal can land safely.
//	As such if you play career you should play on Annoyingly Hard Mode.

// ==== Duna ====
//Duna Space Program is largely easier than stock Kerbin, for obvious reasons.
//However, thinner atmosphere means spaceplanes and parachutes work horribly.
//	Also, Realistic Atmospheres raises the ceiling to 75 km.
//	Returning from the first missions can be a problem without working parachutes.
//	Build light and add crumple space such as girders.
//	Solar panels are not as strong here.
// About RestoredDuna
//RestoredDuna is the pre-0.21 version of Duna, before it was ruined by a botched revamp.
//	Remember to install DunaRestorationProject if you use RestoredDuna while switching
//	between different space centers in a single save file.

// ==== Dres ====
//If selected as the home world, Dres will spawn asteroids in lower orbits than stock,
//	making career mode science a little easier and making for convenient fuel sources.
//	This is offset by Dres' wild inclination, making interplanetary visits difficult.
//	Solar panels are considerably weaker here.

// ==== Jool (aka: Impossible Mode) ====
//Jool puts the space center on a 63 km high plateau made of fairy dust and chlorine,
//	where the air is approximately 2-3 atmospheres thick.
//Jool's RA atmosphere is 550km high. It is also slightly smaller than Earth, and has 4/5ths the surface gravity.
//	In addition to the thick atmosphere at the launch site, Jool is slightly more difficult
//	to launch from than Earth in the Real Solar System.
//	This Jool has a hazardous body configuration, but doesn't seem to take effect above 50 km.
//To reset to the default stock atmosphere, set AspRealisticAtmospheres to False.
//	This will make it easier, more authentic to stock, but less realistic.
//	With stock atmosphere, plataeu is raised to 80 km.
//I recommend the SMURFF mod to lower tank and engine masses to realistic proportions, so it is a little easier.
//Hypothetically, Realism Overhaul would also be practical here, but I don't know how all of it would react
//	to not having an "Earth" or the real solar system.

// ==== Laythe ====
//Laythe is fairly straightforward. 3/5ths atmosphere and 4/5ths gravity.
//	Kerbin but easier and with lots of nearby targets.
//	Solar panels are much weaker here.
//Realistic Atmospheres raises the ceiling to 55 km but thins the upper atmosphere considerably.

// ==== Tylo ====
//Tylo with the Stock atmosphere puts the space program on a mountaintop,
//	possibly the highest point on the equator. (by coincidence, that wasn't planned.)
//Tylo's lack of atmosphere makes returning from orbit just as difficult as getting into orbit in the first place.
//	You're going to want the throttleable engine asap.
//With Realistic Atmospheres, Tylo gets an inert atmosphere with about 0.2 atm in the lowest points,
//	so the launch site is moved to a lowland crater in this mode. Tylo's ceiling is 40 km.
//	A modified Aeris 4A can get to Tylo orbit and return safely in stock aerodynamics.

//!!Bonus Challenges!! (Post your responses in the thread!)
//----------------------------------------------------------

//Challenge 1: Tylo Speed Record. (Stock no-atmosphere)
//Normal: Get to orbit within the distance of the runway on Tylo.
//Hard: Get to escape velocity within the distance of the runway on Tylo.
//Super-Hard: Transfer to another planet (not Jool) or moon within the distance of the runway on Tylo.

//Challenge 2: Solid Rocket To Orbit And Landing
//Normal: Using only Solid Rockets with no parachutes, launch into orbit from Duna and land safely.
//Hard: Using only Solid Rockets, launch into orbit from Tylo and land safely.
//Super-Hard: Using only Solid Rockets, launch a mission from Tylo to Laythe and back, and land safely.
//RCS is allowed, but only for docking or rotation where applicable.

//Challenge 3: Difficult Round Trip
//Normal: Starting from Eve, launch a mission to the surfaces of Bin and Mun
//	and then return back to Eve Space Center.
//Hard: Starting from Jool, launch a mission to Eve's surface
//	and then return back to Jool Space Center.
//Super-Hard: Impress me.

//Challenge 4: Interplanetary Airlines
//Normal: Starting from Laythe, flyby Vall or Tylo. The catch: you must accelerate only in the atmosphere.
//	You can use jets or rockets to do so.
//Hard: You must plot a free-return and land back at Laythe Space Center with no rocket thrust in space.
//Super-Hard: Impress me.

//Challenge 5: Bin Space Program
//	Note that pre-ASP 1.5.1 didn't have the KSC peninsula on Bin; this version does.
//Normal: Starting from any planet, launch a base of 18 or more kerbals, mining and refining equipment,
//	and an orbital launch vehicle, and land it where the stock KSC on Bin should be.
//	Hints: The KSC continent has multiple biomes and one of them has to be suitable for mining.
//	Try the Bon Voyage add-on to automate trucking fuel to your BSC.
//Hard Mode: The launch vehicle must be able to launch from Bin to the Mun.
//Super-Hard: Do the "Bin Two" mission; land on both Minmus and the Mun, and return to your BSC.
//	Bonus for returning (not transmitting) gathered science to your home world.
