		#aspLOC_000001 = Home to the Kerbals and all that is purple, Eve is the purplest planet in the solar system. It's also the hottest planet, the most inhospitable to most types of life.\\nn\\nnNot Kerbal life though. Kerbal life thrives on the purple rocks that give Eve its distinct color.
		#aspLOC_000002 = Kerbin is a small, cool, rocky world with liquid oceans and solid ice caps that are made from the hazardous chemical "Dihydrogen Monoxide."\\nn\\nnAside from its poisonous, blue oceans, Kerbin is a nice place with green plains, brown deserts, and white mountains.
		#aspLOC_000003 = Bin^N
		#aspLOC_000004 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.\\nn\\nnThe Mun was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, it can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Kerbin.
		#aspLOC_000005 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin. It can be seen on very rare clear days as a tiny blue speck neighboring Kerbin.\\nn\\nnMinmus is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon nevertheless.
		//"The Ike" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, you know...
		#aspLOC_000006 = The Ike is a relatively large, grey object occasionally seen hanging in the sky, depending on what side of the planet you're on. Scientists have postulated that the Ike is seemingly perfectly positioned to sneakily interfere with any object that presumes to fly away from or toward Duna.\\nn\\nnThe Ike's discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted it didn't happen all that long ago, but its still fair to say that Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
		#aspLOC_000007 = The Ike^N
		#aspLOC_000008 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Kerbin.\\nn\\nnLuckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that the telescope was pointed away from the Sun, not toward it.\\nn\\nnThe intern was shortly "promoted" afterwards and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
		#aspLOC_000009 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. Its one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint.\\nn\\nnSome have noted that it could be considered a very large version of Duna. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures... Actually, it's not very similar at all is it? Who are these people?
		// Some of these may be duplicates but the descriptions may be slightly different depending on the home world.
		#aspLOC_000010 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.\\nn\\nnThe Mun was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, the Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky right next to Kerbin.
		#aspLOC_000011 = Mun^N
		#aspLOC_000012 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin. On those extremely rare clear nights, it can be seen as a tiny blue speck next to Kerbin.\\nn\\nnDue to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has become synonymous with being an accomplished astronomer.
		#aspLOC_000013 = Gilly is the smallest known satellite in the entire solar system.\\nn\\nnIt was thought to be a planet for a very long time due to its small apparent size in the sky, until an astronomer decided to figure out what its trajectory should be. When he realized that it could not orbit the sun according to the known laws of gravitation, he realized that Gilly was in fact a satellite of Eve this whole time!
		#aspLOC_000014 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Kerbin.\\nn\\nnLuckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that, "the big green thing next to it probably isn't a moon."\\nn\\nnThe intern was shortly "promoted" afterwards and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
		#aspLOC_000015 = Pol is the fifth and final known moon of Jool. It is very rarely visible due to its small size, and is often mistaken for a particularly buoyant sinker.
		#aspLOC_000016 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It's one of the more visible objects outside of the Joolean system in the sky.\\nn\\nnIt was first suspected to be a purple sister planet to Kerbin, but new research suggests that it may be nothing like Kerbin at all!
		#aspLOC_000017 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.
		#aspLOC_000018 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin.\\nn\\nnThere is an ongoing debate about whether or not Minmus is made out of ice, rocks, mint pudding, or bleu cheese.
		#aspLOC_000019 = Vall is a medium sized chunk of ice orbiting Jool.\\nn\\nnJool's own gravity may be squeezing Vall enough that its interior could have melted to form an ocean. If so, it would be a terrific place to search for life.
		#aspLOC_000020 = Tylo is the largest moon orbiting Jool. It is white with large brown craters dotting the surface.\\nn\\nnTylo's discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted it didn't happen all that long ago, but its still fair to say that Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
		#aspLOC_000021 = Bop is the fourth moon of Jool.\\nn\\nnRarely seen through the hazy upper cloud layers, it is often mistaken for a distant floater or a set of dead pixels. The Joolian Astronomical Society insists it's a real satellite nonetheless.
		#aspLOC_000022 = The hardest to spot object that was known since antiquity, Pol is rather difficult to see on account of its small size, especially when you're using a telescope near the dusty mineral jets of the south.
		#aspLOC_000023 = Kerbin is in many ways a hotter, more active version of Tylo, or perhaps Laythe's distant twin. It is the only object other than Laythe to have liquid water oceans coating its surface.
		#aspLOC_000024 = Jool is a unique world in the Kerbol System. It is the largest of the planets, only the Sun itself (small though it appears in the sky) answers to Jool's might.\\nn\\nnJool is home to a wide variety of biodiversity, including the Hunters, Sinkers, Floaters, and of course the Kerbals. With seemingly just the right chemical makeup to make life impossible, it is only around the Pillars of Meander that any nutrients can be taken from the otherwise surfaceless giant planet.\\nn\\nnIt is often said that he who can get their spacecraft into orbit around Jool is almost all the way to anywhere, by virtue of its three large moons.
		#aspLOC_000025 = Equatorial Cloud Belt
		#aspLOC_000026 = Temperate Cloud Belt
		#aspLOC_000027 = Polar Cloud Belt
		#aspLOC_000028 = Great Green Spot
		#aspLOC_000029 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It's one of the more visible objects outside of the Joolean system in the sky.\\nn\\nnIt was first suspected to be a purple sister planet to Kerbin, but new research suggests that it may be nothing like Kerbin at all!
		#aspLOC_000030 = Jool was the very first celestial object discovered by Kerbalkind. Its bright green color stood out in the night sky but was not too hard to look at unlike the Sun.\\nn\\nnLife likely owes its existence to Jool. Without its huge gravity well to keep Laythe locked in a stable orbit, there's surely no way that life could ever develop. Fringe scientists posit that life could develop anywhere where there's liquid water, but this is just absurd.
		#aspLOC_000031 = Vall is a medium sized chunk of ice orbiting Jool.\\nn\\nnIt may have an underwater ocean. If so, it's possible that ocean may have life brought from Laythe to Vall by swapping meteorites. Panspermia is a heck of a thing.
		#aspLOC_000032 = Bop is the second smallest moon orbiting Jool. From the surface of Laythe, it can sometimes be seen on clear days as a tiny brown speck in the sky.\\nn\\nnIt is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon nevertheless.
		#aspLOC_000033 = The hardest to spot object that was known since antiquity, Pol is rather difficult to see on account of its small size, especially when you're using a telescope near a dusty field.
		#aspLOC_000034 = Kerbin is covered in liquid water, much like Laythe, but it has a significant amount of land mass.\\nn\\nnSome crazy fringe scientists believe that the green surface is not to due rusted copper, but instead due to macroscopic, ground based life. Such an idea is absurd, as any unprotected creature would surely perish in the high-radiation environment above the water.
		#aspLOC_000035 = Laythe is the innermost moon of Jool and home to Kerbalkind. It barely but completely maintains the conditions to produce a huge supply of the eager, green creatures.\\nn\\nnLaythe's surface is poisonous to most Kerbals, but underwater and underground the environment is much more hospitable. Indeed, evolutionary scientists have suspected that the cave-dwelling kerbanderthal ancestors had only recently left the oceans. No complex surface life could develop naturally.
		#aspLOC_000037 = A unique world, Kerbin has flat plains, soaring mountains and wide, blue oceans.\\nn\\nnWith over 60% of its surface covered in water, an oxygenated atmosphere, and its close distance to the sun, Kerbin would seem to be perfect for Kerbal life. So why, then, are we on Duna?
		#aspLOC_000038 = Our home planet Duna has been held in much awe, due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the color green.\\nn\\nnDespite its skin-opposing, rusty-iron surface and carbon dioxide atmosphere, it's just habitable enough for Kerbal life.
		#aspLOC_000039 = Northern Basin
		#aspLOC_000040 = Southern Basin
		#aspLOC_000041 = Kerbin has long been a wonder to those litres of Minmum that venture out to the surface of our tiny little moon.\\nn\\nnKerbin's blue seas of almost pure water stands in stark contrast to the colonial Ocean of Minmus, and with minerals making up the surface, it would be an interesting place to visit for sure.
		#aspLOC_000042 = The Mun is the larger of the two satellites of Kerbin. A dry, purely mineral surface appears to be entirely uninhabitable.\\nn\\nnIt was long known by surface explorers that Kerbin had an orbiting companion, but it took embarrassingly long to realize that Minmus itself orbited Kerbin as well.
		#aspLOC_000043 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered into the collective memory because we thought it was Kerbin.\\nn\\nnLuckily this error was corrected when a couple gallons in the southern flats realized that telescopes don't work that way.\\nn\\nnThat fluid was shortly afterwards "promoted" and respecialized as a rocket test subject.
		#aspLOC_000044 = Jool is rather known for being a particularly large, predominantly green planet.\\nn\\nnThe Ocean has longed to visit it ever since a couple thousand gallons under the highlands hypothesized that Jool could have some of the elements neccesary for Minmus life.
		#aspLOC_000045 = Minmus is the outermost satellite of Kerbin, and the minty-fresh homeworld of The Ocean\\nn\\nnThe Ocean is a region of liquid biomaterial within the icy crust of Minmus that makes up the singular colony life form on the world. Indivudal clusters of cells can be trained to hold a specific form. The form developed for space travel experimentation is a seemingly undepletable one: Kerbals.
		#aspLOC_000046 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.\\nn\\nnIt was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Kerbin.
		#aspLOC_000047 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin. On days without dust storms, it can be seen as a tiny blue speck next to Kerbin.\\nn\\nnIt is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon never the less.
		#aspLOC_000049 = Dune Plains
		#aspLOC_000050 = Maria
		#aspLOC_000051 = Maria Basins
		#aspLOC_000052 = Dark Spots
		#aspLOC_000053 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It's one of the more visible objects outside of the Joolean system in the sky.\\nn\\nnIt was first suspected to be a purple sister planet to Kerbin, but new research suggests that it may be nothing like Kerbin at all!
		#aspLOC_000054 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.\\nn\\nnIt was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, the Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Kerbin.
		#aspLOC_000055 = Jool was the very first celestial object discovered by Kerbalkind. Its bright green color stood out in the night sky but was not too hard to look at unlike the Sun.\\nn\\nnJool is host to four other satellite planets, or "moons."
		#aspLOC_000056 = Laythe is the first moon of Jool. It is about the same size as Tylo, and by some considerations it is a sister planet to Tylo.\\nn\\nnTidal heating from its low orbit around Jool have caused its icy crust to melt into a global liquid water ocean, the cause of its characteristic blue color.
		#aspLOC_000057 = Bop is the second smallest moon orbiting Jool. From the surface of Tylo, it can sometimes be seen as a tiny brown speck in the vacuum of the sky.\\nn\\nnIt is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon nevertheless.
		#aspLOC_000058 = Kerbin is covered in liquid water, much like Tylo's sister moon Laythe, but it has a significant amount of land mass.\\nn\\nnSome crazy fringe scientists believe that the green surface is not to due rusted copper, but instead due to macroscopic, surface based life. Such an idea is absurd, any unprotected creature would surely perish in the high-radiation environment above the caves.
		#aspLOC_000059 = Tylo is a large satellite planet orbiting Jool. Home to the Cavekerbals, its complex system of underground caves have just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable supply of the cave dwellers.\\nn\\nnThe dirty ice covering remains a cold exterior on the surface, but travellers who have visited the surface say that the view of Jool, Laythe, and Vall hanging overhead is "Quite Something."
		#aspLOC_000060 = ZX-20 Modified Experimental Electrified Cell
		#aspLOC_000061 = The ZX-20 Experimental Electrified Cell is a small, experimental storage device for electricity. It just has one small problem: it slowly leaks electricity out of the system. As such, it can hold about 7 hours of charge before it is depleted. Less if there is a power drain. The director of electrical research mandates the following, unintelligable warning: THIS IS A MODDED PART. IT DOES NOT EXIST IN STOCK KSP. LOCATION: AlienSpacePrograms/TyloSpaceProgram/TyloTechTree.cfg.
		#aspLOC_000062 = The Sun is the literal star of the Kerbol system.\\nn\\nnScientists have noted a particular burning sensation and potential loss of vision if it is stared at for long periods of time. This is especially important to keep in mind considering the effect shiny objects have on the average Kerbal.
		#aspLOC_000063 = Moho is named after a fiery place in Kerbal mythology with oceans of flowing lava. In reality, however, it's much less interesting.\\nn\\nnScientists speculate about possible ways to make it awesome like in the stories. 
		#aspLOC_000064 = Gilly is a lumpy rock wandering around the orbit of Eve.\\nn\\nnDue to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has now become synonymous with becoming an accomplished Astronomer.
		#aspLOC_000065 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Kerbin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.\\nn\\nnSounds very familiar.
		#aspLOC_000066 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Kerbin.\\nn\\nnIt is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon never the less.
		#aspLOC_000067 = Duna is the fourth planet from its sun and the fourth-largest planet in its system.\\nn\\nnThe planet is held in much awe due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the color grey.
		#aspLOC_000068 = Kerbin is a beautiful planet with deep blue oceans, wide open skies, and lush green lands.\\nn\\nnWe set out to colonize this ideallic planet, but instead we ended up on Dres.
		#aspLOC_000069 = When we set out to colonize this system, Dres was the first world we encountered due to our high approach inclination. Nearby asteroids crippled our colony craft, and we had to land here.\\nn\\nnNavigating these asteroids will be the first thing our budding space program has to achieve, and using their resources may help us reach our original target: Kerbin.

		//Tylo Science Definitions with Realistic Atmospheres
		#traLOC_000001 = There's something resisting your momentum up here. Wasn't Tylo supposed to be airless?
		#traLOC_000002 = There isn't much of an atmosphere, but it's there.
		#traLOC_000003 = Don't let go... don't let go... don't let go...
		#traLOC_000004 = You hope your parachute still works here.
		#traLOC_000005 = It's like a freezer in a cave on a featureless moon. Oh, wait...
		#traLOC_000006 = The Goo is not feeling at home as it was higher up.
		#traLOC_000007 = The Goo jiggles, wobbles, clumps into spheres and becomes brittle, all at once.
		#traLOC_000008 = One of the samples is hardening, and is on the verge of shattering. The others don't react at all.
		#traLOC_000009 = The high radiation environment caused a few of the samples to glow. One of those samples is hardening.
		#traLOC_000010 = The sunlight doesn't seem to raise temperatures here much.
		#traLOC_000011 = It's almost, but not quite, like space.
		#traLOC_000012 = Didn't they have a name for this kind of cold? Oh right: 'Winnipeg.'
		#traLOC_000013 = It's bloody freezing out here! Good thing the block heater still works.
		#traLOC_000014 = It's bloody freezing out here! Good thing the block heater still works.
		#traLOC_000015 = Okay, whose idea was it to build our facilities in this ice bucket?
		#traLOC_000016 = The air, if you could call it that, is really cold at night and not- as- cold- but- still- really cold in the day.
		#traLOC_000017 = It's faint, but there's some atmospheric pressure here.
		#traLOC_000018 = No atmosphere, they told you. A barometer wouldn't work, they told you. So much for them.
		#traLOC_000019 = Yep, definitely an atmosphere.
		#traLOC_000020 = Picking up traces of nitrogen up here.
		#traLOC_000021 = Nothing but nitrogen all around. And maybe bits of dust. You hope you can clean it out.
		#traLOC_000022 = Once the dust settled from landing, you found nitrogen and maybe traces of other stuff.
		#traLOC_000023 = Isn't this the stuff they fill tires with back home? You look for your green valve caps.
		#traLOC_000024 = Isn't this the stuff they fill tires with back home? You look for your green valve caps.
		#traLOC_000025 = Looks pretty cold out there.

		//Jool Biome and Great Green Spot Science Definitions
		#jbLOC_000024 = Jool is particularly known for being big and green. Kerbalkind has longed to visit it since it was first spotted in the sky. Philosophers reason that the swirling green planet must be a really nice place to visit, on account of its wholesome coloration.\n\n Jool features a dark spot, like a single giant eye, that has puzzled Kerbal scientists for centuries. Opinion is divided over whether the great planet is winking at us.
		#jbLOC_000025 = Equatorial Cloud Belt
		#jbLOC_000026 = Temperate Cloud Belt
		#jbLOC_000027 = Polar Cloud Belt
		#jbLOC_000028 = Great Green Spot
		#jbLOC_000029 = You look nervously out the window. The cloudbanks below you look disconcertingly deep.
		#jbLOC_000030 = At this distance, the giant planet seems to be winking at you.
		#jbLOC_000031 = Don't look down.  Don't look down.  Don't look-- aw, crap!
		#jbLOC_000032 = You decide to add, "Hey, why not step outside in the depths of a gas giant's atmosphere!" to the list of things that seemed like a good idea at the time.
		#jbLOC_000033 = It's "temperate," they said.  Just step outside a moment, they said.  Piece of cake, they said.
		#jbLOC_000034 = You thought you were afraid of heights... turns out, what you were actually afraid of was DEPTHS.
		#jbLOC_000035 = As you gaze long into the abyss, you get the uncomfortable feeling that the abyss gazes back into you.
		#jbLOC_000036 = The churning clouds of the great planet's equatorial zone are a balmy minus... um... lots.
		#jbLOC_000037 = The calm zone between equator and poles shows a striking uniformity of temperature.
		#jbLOC_000038 = If you have to ask, you really don't want to know how cold it is.
		#jbLOC_000039 = The towering storm fronts of the Spot appear to be warmer than the rest of the planet.
		#jbLOC_000040 = The giant planet's massive gravity well drowns out all other signals.
		#jbLOC_000041 = Gravity flux appears unusually quiet in the mid-latitudes.
		#jbLOC_000042 = Faint streams of gravioli particles appear to be heading towards the pole.
		#jbLOC_000043 = The gravity field twitches slightly as you pass over the Spot.
		#jbLOC_000044 = The churning masses of Jool's equatorial clouds cause a chaotic gravitational signature.
		#jbLOC_000045 = Yep, there's a lot of gravity going around, all right.
		#jbLOC_000046 = Great rivers of gravioli particles swirl down into the pole.
		#jbLOC_000047 = The density fluctuations of the Spot cause a noticeable bump in the planet's gravity field.
		#jbLOC_000048 = Hydrogen, spiced with toxic sulfur compounds.  How... fragrant.
		#jbLOC_000049 = Hydrogen, hydrogen everywhere. The green color must be coming from something below.
		#jbLOC_000050 = Tiny methane crystals swirl through the hydrogen-helium mix in the detector.
		#jbLOC_000051 = You begin to pick up traces of the complex organic compounds that give the Spot its characteristic color.
		#jbLOC_000052 = So, here you are down in the guts of a gas giant. You begin to consider the benefits that "up" might offer.
		#jbLOC_000053 = Oh, look. More clouds.
		#jbLOC_000054 = Icy swirls of methane gas plunge into the murky depths below.
		#jbLOC_000055 = Well, you were nervous going this deep into Jool's menacing atmosphere, but at least you're not flying right into the middle of a gigantic Kerbin-sized hurricane, where the winds would crush a-- Oh, wait.  Never mind.
		#jbLOC_000056 = The clouds below swirl as they whip 'round the giant planet's turbulent equator.
		#jbLOC_000057 = The clouds in Jool's middle latitudes appear to be a relatively calm zone between the turbulent equator and the frigid poles.
		#jbLOC_000058 = The clouds below you form an icy, swirling vortex about the great planet's pole.
		#jbLOC_000059 = Well, you suppose it's a pretty good green spot, but not great.
		#jbLOC_000060 = Either the dense equatorial clouds are rich in hydrogen sulfide gas, or else someone accidentally left an egg sandwich in the detector.
		#jbLOC_000061 = The atmosphere of the middle latitudes appears to be nearly pure hydrogen.  So where's all this green coming from?
		#jbLOC_000062 = The predominantly hydrogen atmosphere shows traces of helium at the poles.
		#jbLOC_000063 = A rich mixture of complex organic compounds threatens to clog the detector.
