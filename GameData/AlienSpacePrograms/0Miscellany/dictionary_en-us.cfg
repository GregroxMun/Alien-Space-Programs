		//The rest are here.
		#aspLOC_000001 = Home to the Kerbals and all that is purple, Eve is the purplest planet in the solar system. It's also the hottest planet, the most inhospitable to most types of life. Not Kerbal life though. Kerbal life thrives on the purple rocks that give Eve its distinct color.
		#aspLOC_000002 = Bin is a small, cool, rocky world with liquid oceans and solid ice caps that are made from the hazardous chemical "Dihydrogen Monoxide." Aside from its poisonous, blue oceans, Bin is a nice place with green plains, brown deserts, and white mountains.
		#aspLOC_000003 = Bin^N
		#aspLOC_000004 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Bin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. It was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Bin.
		#aspLOC_000005 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Bin. It is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon never the less.
		//"The Ike" doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, you know...
		#aspLOC_000006 = The Ike is a relatively large, grey object occasionally seen hanging in the sky, depending on what side of the planet you're on. Scientists have postulated that Ike is seemingly perfectly positioned to sneakily interfere with any object that presumes to fly away from or toward Duna. Ike's discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted it didn't happen all that long ago, but its still fair to say that Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
		#aspLOC_000007 = The Ike^N
		#aspLOC_000008 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Bin. Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that the telescope was pointed away from the Sun, not toward it. The intern was shortly "promoted" afterwards and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
		#aspLOC_000009 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. Its one of the larger, most visible objects, mainly because of its very, very purple tint. Some have noted that it could be considered a very large version of Duna. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures... Actually, it's not very similar at all is it? Who are these people?
		// Some of these may be duplicates but the descriptions may be slightly different depending on the home world.
		#aspLOC_000010 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Bin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. It was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Bin.
		#aspLOC_000011 = Mun^N
		#aspLOC_000012 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Bin. Due to the large amount of squinting and eye strain associated with its discovery, wearing glasses has become synonymous with being an accomplished astronomer.
		#aspLOC_000013 = Gilly is the smallest known satellite in the entire solar system. It was thought to be a planet for a very long time due to its small apparent size in the sky, until an astronomer decided to figure out what its trajectory should be. When he realized that it could not orbit the sun according to the known laws of gravitation, he realized that Gilly was in fact a satellite of Eve this whole time!
		#aspLOC_000014 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Bin. Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that, "the big green thing next to it probably isn't a moon." The intern was shortly "promoted" afterwards and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
		#aspLOC_000015 = Pol is the fifth and final known moon of Jool. It is very rarely visible due to its smallsize, and is often mistaken for a particularly buoyant sinker.
		#aspLOC_000016 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It's one of the more visible objects outside of the Joolean system in the sky. It was first suspected to be a purple sister planet to Bin, but new research suggests that it may be nothing like Bin at all!
		#aspLOC_000017 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Bin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface.
		#aspLOC_000018 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Bin. There is an ongoing debate about whether or not Minmus is made out of ice, rocks, mint pudding, or bleu cheese.
		#aspLOC_000019 = Vall is a medium sized chunk of ice orbiting Jool. Jool's own gravity may be squeezing Vall enough that its interior could have melted to form an ocean. If so, it would be a terrific place to search for life.
		#aspLOC_000020 = Tylo is the largest moon orbiting Jool. It is white with large brown craters dotting the surface. Tylo's discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted it didn't happen all that long ago, but its still fair to say that Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.
		#aspLOC_000021 = Bop is the fourth moon of Jool. Rarely seen through the hazy upper cloud layers, it is often mistaken for a distant floater or a set of dead pixels. The Joolian Astronomical Society insists it's a real satellite nonetheless.
		#aspLOC_000022 = The hardest to spot object that was known since antiquity, Pol is rather difficult to see on account of its small size, especially when you're using a telescope near the dusty mineral jets of the south.
		#aspLOC_000023 = Bin is in many ways a hotter, more active version of Tylo, or perhaps Laythe's distant twin. It is the only object other than Laythe to have liquid water oceans coating its surface.
		#aspLOC_000024 = Jool is a unique world in the Kerbol System. It is the largest of the planets, only the Sun itself (small though it appears in the sky) answers to Jool's might. Jool is home to a wide variety of biodiversity, including the Hunters, Sinkers, Floaters, and of course the Kerbals. With seemingly just the right chemical makeup to make life impossible, it is only around the Pillars of Meander that any nutrients can be taken from the otherwise surfaceless giant planet. It is often said that he who can get their spacecraft into orbit around Jool is almost all the way to anywhere, by virtue of its three large moons.
		#aspLOC_000025 = Equatorial Cloud Belt
		#aspLOC_000026 = Temperate Cloud Belt
		#aspLOC_000027 = Polar Cloud Belt
		#aspLOC_000028 = Great Green Spot
		#aspLOC_000029 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It's one of the more visible objects outside of the Joolean system in the sky. It was first suspected to be a purple sister planet to Bin, but new research suggests that it may be nothing like Bin at all!
		#aspLOC_000030 = Jool was the very first celestial object discovered by Kerbalkind. Its bright green color stood out in the night sky but was not too hard to look at unlike the Sun. Life likely owes its existence to Jool. Without its huge gravity well to keep Laythe locked in a stable orbit, there's surely no way that life could ever develop. Fringe scientists posit that life could develop anywhere where there's liquid water, but this is just absurd.
		#aspLOC_000031 = Vall is a medium sized chunk of ice orbiting Jool. It may have an underwater ocean. If so, it's possible that ocean may have life brought from Laythe to Vall by swapping meteorites. Panspermia is a heck of a thing.
		#aspLOC_000032 = Bop is the second smallest moon orbiting Jool. From the surface of Laythe, it can sometimes be seen on clear days as a tiny brown speck in the sky. It is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon nevertheless.
		#aspLOC_000033 = The hardest to spot object that was known since antiquity, Pol is rather difficult to see on account of its small size, especially when you're using a telescope near a dusty field.
		#aspLOC_000034 = Bin is covered in liquid water, much like Laythe, but it has a significant amount of land mass. Some crazy fringe scientists believe that the green surface is not to due rusted copper, but instead due to macroscopic, ground based life. Such an idea is absurd, any unprotected creature would surely perish in the high-radiation environment above the water.
		#aspLOC_000035 = Laythe is the innermost moon of Jool and home to Kerbalkind. It barely but completely maintains the conditions to produce a huge supply of the eager, green creatures.  Laythe's surface is poisonous to most Kerbals, but underwater and underground the environment is much more hospitable. Indeed, evolutionary scientists have suspected that the cave-dwelling kerbanderthal ancestors had only recently left the oceans. No complex surface life could develop naturally.
		#aspLOC_000037 = A unique world, Bin has flat plains, soaring mountains and wide, blue oceans. With over 60% of its surface covered in water, an oxygenated atmosphere, and its close distance to the sun, Kerbin would seem to be perfect for Kerbal life. So why, then, are we on Duna?
		#aspLOC_000038 = Our home planet Duna has been held in much awe, due to its striking red color and stark contrast to the color green. Despite its skin-opposing, rusty-iron surface and carbon dioxide atmosphere, it's just habitable enough for Kerbal life.
		#aspLOC_000039 = Northern Basin
		#aspLOC_000040 = Southern Basin
		#aspLOC_000041 = Bin has long been a wonder to those litres of Minmum that venture out to the surface of our tiny little moon. Bin's blue seas of almost pure water stands in stark contrast to the colonial Ocean of Minmus, and with minerals making up the surface, it would be an interesting place to visit for sure.
		#aspLOC_000042 = The Mun is the larger of the two satellites of Bin. A dry, purely mineral surface appears to be entirely uninhabitable. It was long known by surface explorers that Bin had an orbiting companion, but it took embarrassingly long to realize that Minmus itself orbited Bin as well.
		#aspLOC_000043 = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered into the collective memory because we thought it was Kerbin. Luckily this error was corrected when a couple gallons in the southern flats realized that telescopes don't work that way. That fluid was shortly afterwards "promoted" and respecialized as a rocket test subject.
		#aspLOC_000044 = Jool is rather known for being a particularly large, predominantly green planet. The Ocean has longed to visit it ever since a couple thousand gallons under the highlands hypothesized that Jool could have some of the elements neccesary for Minmus life.
		#aspLOC_000045 = Minmus is the outermost satellite of Bin, and the minty-fresh homeworld of The Ocean. The Ocean is a region of liquid biomaterial within the icy crust of Minmus that makes up the singular colony life form on the world. Indivudal clusters of cells can be trained to hold a specific form. The form developed for space travel experimentation is a seemingly undepletable one: Kerbals.
		#aspLOC_000046 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Bin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. It was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Bin.
		#aspLOC_000047 = Minmus is the smallest moon orbiting Bin. It is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon never the less.
		#aspLOC_000049 = Dune Plains
		#aspLOC_000050 = Maria
		#aspLOC_000051 = Maria Basins
		#aspLOC_000052 = Dark Spots
		#aspLOC_000053 = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It's one of the more visible objects outside of the Joolean system in the sky. It was first suspected to be a purple sister planet to Bin, but new research suggests that it may be nothing like Bin at all!
		#aspLOC_000054 = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Bin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. It was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, the Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Bin.
		#aspLOC_000055 = Jool was the very first celestial object discovered by Kerbalkind. Its bright green color stood out in the night sky but was not too hard to look at unlike the Sun. Jool is host to four other satellite planets, or "Moons."
		#aspLOC_000056 = Laythe is the first moon of Jool. It is about the same size as Tylo, and by some considerations it is a sister planet to Tylo. Tidal heating from its low orbit around Jool have caused its icy crust to melt into a global liquid water ocean, the cause of its characteristic blue color.
		#aspLOC_000057 = Bop is the second smallest moon orbiting Jool. From the surface of Tylo, it can sometimes be seen on clear days as a tiny brown speck in the sky. It is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon nevertheless.
		#aspLOC_000058 = Bin is covered in liquid water, much like Tylo's sister moon Laythe, but it has a significant amount of land mass. Some crazy fringe scientists believe that the green surface is not to due rusted copper, but instead due to macroscopic, surface based life. Such an idea is absurd, any unprotected creature would surely perish in the high-radiation environment above the caves.
		#aspLOC_000059 = Tylo is a large satellite planet orbiting Jool. Home to the Cavekerbals, its complex system of underground caves have just the right conditions to support a vast, seemingly undepletable supply of the cave dwellers. The dirty ice covering remains a cold exterior on the surface, but travellers who have visited the surface say that the view of Jool, Laythe, and Vall hanging overhead is "Quite Something."
		#aspLOC_000060 = ZX-20 Modified Experimental Electrified Cell
		#aspLOC_000061 = The ZX-20 Experimental Electrified Cell is a small, experimental storage device for electricity. It just has one small problem: it slowly leaks electricity out of the system. As such, it can hold about 7 hours of charge before it is depleted. Less if there is a power drain. The director of electrical research mandates the following, unintelligable warning: THIS IS A MODDED PART. IT DOES NOT EXIST IN STOCK KSP.
