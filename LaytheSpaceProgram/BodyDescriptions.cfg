	{
		@Properties
		{
			description = Eve is certainly the purplest object in the solar system. It's one of the more visible objects outside of the Joolean system in the sky. It was first suspected to be a purple sister planet to Bin, but new research suggests that it may be nothing like Bin at all!

		@Properties
		{
			description = The Mun is a large satellite orbiting Bin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. It was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Bin.

			description = Jool was the very first celestial object discovered by Kerbalkind. Its bright green color stood out in the night sky but was not too hard to look at unlike the Sun. Life likely owes its existence to Jool. Without its huge gravity well to keep Laythe locked in a stable orbit, there's surely no way that life could ever develop. Fringe scientists posit that life could develop anywhere where there's liquid water, but this is just absurd.

	//Laythe's description is in LaytheSpaceProgram.cfg
	@Body[Vall]
	{
		@Properties
		{
			description = Vall is a medium sized chunk of ice orbiting Jool. It may have an underwater ocean. If so, it's possible that ocean may have life brought from Laythe to Vall by swapping meteorites. Panspermia is a heck of a thing.

			description = Tylo is the largest moon orbiting Jool. It is white with large brown craters dotting the surface. Tylo's discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted it didn't happen all that long ago, but its still fair to say that Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.

			description = Bop is the second smallest moon orbiting Jool. From the surface of Laythe, it can sometimes be seen on clear days as a tiny brown speck in the sky. It is often mistaken as dirt on the telescope lenses or dead pixels, but the top minds at the Kerbal Astronomical Society assure us that it is a real moon nevertheless.
