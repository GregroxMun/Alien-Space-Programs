		//explanation for name: Sigma88 was making most of this config, and I was trying to paste together some fixes to get this to work. Now, flash back to around September 2015, when I was first working on Alternis Kerbol Rekerjiggered. I was pretty sure that you couldn't give AlternisTylo a colored atmosphere, but then Sigma88 came along on the Kopernicus IRC with a screenshot of Tylo with a working atmosphere. It worked by swapping Tylo's template for Duna's template. In the lower right corner was the pilot of the test craft: GregSux Kerman. We all had a good ol' laugh. Fast forward to today, 1/19/2016, and I had both a bit to remove and a bit to modfy Kerbin in the exact same config. I didn't notice this. Thus, Sigma88 had every right to label the planet "GregSux"

            description = When Bin was first observed through a telescope, the picture was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Laythe.Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that “telescopes don’t work that way”.The intern was shortly afterwards “promoted” and moved to the experimental rocket testing program. Bin is covered in liquid water, much like Laythe, but it has a significant amount of land mass. Some crazy fringe scientists believe that the green surface is not to due rusted copper, but instead due to macroscopic, ground based life. Such an idea is absurd, any unprotected creature would surely perish in the high-radiation environment above the water.

			description = Laythe is the innermost moon of Jool, and home to Kerbalkind. It just barely maintains the conditions to produce a huge supply of the eager, green creatures. Laythe's surface is poisonous to most Kerbals, but underwater and underground the environment is much more hospitable. Indeed, evolutionary scientists have suspected that the cave-dwelling Kerbanderthal ancestors had only recently left the oceans. No complex surface life could develop naturally.
