	{
		@Properties
		{
			%description = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Bin. Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that, "the big green thing next to it probably isn't a moon." The intern was shortly "promoted" afterwards and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
