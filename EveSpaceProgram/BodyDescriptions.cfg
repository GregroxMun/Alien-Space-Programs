			description = The Mun, is a large satellite orbiting Bin. It is mostly gray in appearance, with craters of various sizes dotting its otherwise smooth surface. It was the first moon of another planet to be discovered due to its relatively large size. Sometimes, Mun can be seen as a separate point of light in the sky next to Bin.

			description = Gilly is the smallest known satellite in the entire solar system. It was thought to be a planet for a very long time due to its small apparent size in the sky, until an astronomer decided to figure out what its trajectory should be. When he realized that it could not orbit the sun according to the known laws of gravitation, he realized that Gilly was in fact a satellite of Eve this whole time!
