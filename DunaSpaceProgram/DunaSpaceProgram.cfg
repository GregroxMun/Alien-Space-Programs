Some have noted that it could be considered a very large version of Duna. Well, despite the purple, and the toxic atmosphere, and the extreme pressures and temperatures… Actually, it’s not very similar at all is it? Who are these people?

		//explanation for name: Sigma88 was making most of this config, and I was trying to paste together some fixes to get this to work. Now, flash back to around September 2015, when I was first working on Alternis Kerbol Rekerjiggered. I was pretty sure that you couldn't give AlternisTylo a colored atmosphere, but then Sigma88 came along on the Kopernicus IRC with a screenshot of Tylo with a working atmosphere. It worked by swapping Tylo's template for Duna's template. In the lower right corner was the pilot of the test craft: GregSux Kerman. We all had a good ol' laugh. Fast forward to today, 1/19/2016, and I had both a bit to remove and a bit to modfy Kerbin in the exact same config. I didn't notice this. Thus, Sigma88 had every right to label the planet "GregSux"

Ike's discovery is widely regarded as one of the more important breakthroughs of Kerbal evolution. Granted it didn’t happen all that long ago, but its still fair to say that Kerbals are wiser and more evolved now than they were back then.

		{
			description = When Laythe was first discovered, it was not entered in the records because the scientist in charge thought he was looking at Bin. Luckily this error was corrected when a plucky intern informed him that the telescope was pointed away from the Sun, not towards it. The intern was shortly afterwards promoted and moved to the experimental rocket testing program.
